## Description

This was originally a university assignment to make specific changes and alterations to an existing project we were handed, i decided to instead create my own project to deminstrate my skills and help myself learn techniques such as Shaders, Object Oriented Programming, Particle Systems (Not Implemented).

Overall i would say i learnt a great deal from doing this project. and my final grade was a ' B- '.

## Features

* Random Shape Generation for the asteroids.
* Lens Distortion and Chromatic Aberration Shaders.
* Simple Incremental Score.
* Options for both Keyboard and Mouse controls (Only changeable via Code. [ Player.cs : line 21 ])

## Reflection
**I've been told to reflect more.**

Alot of these reflections do follow a theme of "i dont know where to start" but really with this project it was one my first and actually proud projects, sure its only Asteroids but it did help me understand entity classes, basic inputs and a shaders that i used to distort the screen helped teach me a great deal about GLSL/HLSL.

Final point: i would love to write this in C++ using a framwork such as SDL2 or SFML

anyway, im done here.. well not done it will be updated if required but like done reflecting and stuff.
